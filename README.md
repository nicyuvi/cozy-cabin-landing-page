A landing page for the Cozy Cabin retreat service built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

View live project: https://cozycabinretreat.netlify.app/

### Features

- Mobile first design and responsive UI
- Form validation / form handling
- ES6 Modules
- JavaScript animations

### What I learned

- Gained a better understanding of absolute positioning on elements
- Solidified my knowledge of vanilla CSS and JavaScript
- Improved organization skills in vanilla CSS
- Learned how to use Intersection Observer API to trigger events on elements based on when the elements come into view.

### Problems I faced

- The trickiest part of this project was the timeline and figuring out how to optimize my time efficiently to complete this project

### What I can Improve On

- The next skill I want to learn is to use Figma to create mockups. This should decrease the amount of time I spend trying different colors and layouts while developing.
- I create wireframes when I plan out my project, but a mockup will let me see exactly how I want the project to look.
